# Project-for-NYC-Collission
# NYC Collision Analysis

This project investigates traffic collision data in New York City to identify patterns, causes, and actionable insights. The findings aim to enhance road safety, improve traffic management, and reduce accidents.

---

## Features
- Analysis of **collision trends** over time and across NYC boroughs.
- Identification of **high-risk locations** for accidents.
- Exploration of **causes of collisions**, such as contributing factors and vehicle types.
- Recommendations for **policy changes** to improve road safety.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on NYC collisions, such as:
- Date, time, and location of incidents.
- Contributing factors (e.g., driver inattention, weather).
- Vehicle types involved (e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles).
- Number of injuries and fatalities.

## Results
Top Insights:

Manhattan experiences the highest collision density due to heavy traffic.
Collisions peak during rush hours (8-10 AM, 4-7 PM).
Driver inattention and failure to yield are leading causes of accidents.
Weather-related collisions increase significantly during rainy conditions.
High-Risk Locations:

Brooklyn: Specific intersections prone to accidents include Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue.
Queens: Northern Boulevard is a major collision hotspot.
